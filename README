This is an out-of-tree kernel module to test the lockless printk
ringbuffer. The kernel module will only work if the lockless printk
ringbuffer is *not* already part of the kernel.


================
Build the module
================

If the kernel build directory is /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

$ make

otherwise

$ BDIR=/kernel/build/dir make


==============
Start the test
==============

$ sudo insmod ./prb.ko

The machine will have a high load, but should be usable during the test.


=============
Test duration
=============

A test of at least an hour would be useful. Letting it run longer might
help to trigger issues. On arm64, I would try to run tests for 30 days.

The system should continue to operate correctly during testing. If at
any time an OOPS or BUG or WARN is triggered, this information should
be sent and the ringbuffer has failed!


=============
Stop the test
=============

$ sudo rmmod prb
$ sudo dmesg > dmesg.txt
$ sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace > trace.txt

Send dmesg.txt and trace.txt to John Ogness <john.ogness@linutronix.de>

Thank you!
